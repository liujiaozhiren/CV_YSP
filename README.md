# Project Title: XXX

## Features
- Utilizes pre-trained AlexNet and ResNet models for feature extraction and beauty score prediction.
- Custom data loader to handle image preprocessing and dataset management.
- Performance evaluation using correlation, MAE, and RMSE metrics.
- Model training and validation loop with progress tracking.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch 2.0.0
- torchvision
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
- tqdm
- numpy

## Installation
Clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://your-repository-link.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset
The project uses the SCUT-FBP550_v2 dataset, which contains facial images and their corresponding beauty scores. Please download the dataset and place it in the `./data/SCUT-FBP550_v2/` directory relative to the project's root.

## Usage
To start the training and evaluation process, simply run the `forward.py` function in the provided script:

```bash
python ./trained_models_for_pytorch/forward.py
```

Ensure the paths to the dataset and model weights are correctly set in the script.

## Model Training & Evaluation
The script will load pre-trained AlexNet or ResNet models and fine-tune them on the facial beauty prediction task. Training progress, including loss and validation metrics, will be displayed in real-time.

After training, the best-performing model will be saved, and its performance on the validation set will be displayed, including the correlation, MAE, and RMSE metrics.
